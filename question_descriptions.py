If two drivers/teams are equal in a category, their position is averaged and rounded down.
Example (Completely made up):
Yuki and Zhou both 41 pit stops over the season, the most of everyone - giving them rank 1.5, worth 18 points. The next driver is Lando, with 40 pit stops, with rank 3 - giving 15 points.
